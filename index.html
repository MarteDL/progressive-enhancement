    <h2>The story</h2>

    <p>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The
        farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in
        the
        evening
        everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
        horses!</q>
        The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
        leg.
        The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The
        next day
        the
        conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
        broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,
        <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <b class="Good">Good</b> and <b class="Bad">Bad</b> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but
        monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's
        not make a big deal out of it...
